 * A momentary on button, also known as a momentary push button or momentary switch, is
 * a type of switch that closes the electrical connection only when it's being pressed. 
 * When you release the button, the connection opens again.
 *
 * Button state is read on a digital input pin.  However, when the button is not pressed
 * the input pin has NO connection to either +5V or Ground.  If you read a digital input pin
 * with no connection the pin will randomly read HIGH or LOW.  This is called a floating
 * pin.
 *
 * If we connect our input pin to ground through a pull-down resistor then the pin will
 * read LOW when not pressed, and HIGH when pressed.
 *
 * The HERO XL does NOT have a built-in pull-down resistor, so we will use an external
 * 10K resistor as our pull-down resistor.

/* Choosing what pin to use.
 * This project only needs digital pins.  So, on the Hero XL we *could* use any digital or analog pin
 * (D0-D53, A0-A15).  However, some pins support specialized functions and in later lessons we will be
 * using multiple parts, some of which will use some of those special functions.  So, let's start out
 * on the right foot by trying to use the most basic pin we can for each of our parts.
 *
 * Skip: A0-A15 (save for Analog),
 *       D0/D1 (used by USB and Serial)
 *       D14-D19 (used by Serial 1-3)
 *       D2/D3, D18-D21 (used for external interrupts)
 *       D13 (this pin controls the build in LED on the HERO XL board (LED_BUILTIN)),
 *       D2-D13, D44-D46 (used for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM))
 *       D50 (MISO), D51 (MOSI), D52 (SCK), D53 (SS).  (used for SPI communication)
 *       D20 (SDA), D21 (SCL).  (used for I2C communication using the Wire library)
 * Recommended for fewest conflicts:
 *    D22-D49
